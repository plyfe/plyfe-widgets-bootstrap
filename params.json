Cards work on mobile, tablets and the desktop.\r\n\r\nCreate\r\n------\r\n\r\nAn easy to use no-coding-required [card builder](https://plyfe.me/cms/) is available for anyone to use to build their own cards. Embedding the cards onto your website is as easy as cutting and pasting the embed HTML code.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nOn [plyfe.com](http://plyfe.com/) there are [examples of live cards](http://plyfe.com/showcase) that you can build using the card builder. Here is an example of the HTML code that you would put on your site to load a trivia card.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"//d2hlj83egq3ows.cloudfront.net/components/plyfe-widgets-bootstrap/dist/plyfe-widgets-bootstrap-v1.1.min.js\"></script>\r\n<div class=\"plyfe-widget\" data-slot=\"S8d\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAPI\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can customize your embedded Plyfe card via a JavaScript API to control how they work on your site. When the bootstrap JS file is loaded there is a global `Plyfe` object that you can use.\r\n\r\n### Initialization\r\n\r\nBy default when the bootstrap file first loads it waits until the DOM is ready then it scans for cards using CSS selector defined in `Plyfe.settings.selector.`\r\n\r\nIf you do not want cards to load automatically you can define a global initalization callback by adding a `data-init-name` to the bootstrap `<script>` tag. If you set the `data-init-name` to `\"PlyfeInit\"` which is a valid function name defined on `window`(e.g. `window.PlyfeInit = function() }{;`) your callback will now be responsible for loading cards.\r\n\r\nIn your custom initialization function you can change setting that you want the bootstrap JS file to use for all cards. Calling `Plyfe.createWidgets()` will scan for cards and load them.\r\n\r\n### Settings <a id=\"settings\"></a>\r\n\r\nYou can customize the settings the bootstrap JS will use to load cards by either editing data attributes on the `<script>` tag or by customizing settings in a custom initialization function.\r\n\r\nYou can change the CSS selector used by `createWidgets()` by changing the `Plyfe.settings.selector` setting.\r\n\r\n#### Plyfe Object\r\n\r\nThe bootstrap JS file creates a `Plyfe` global on `window`. It has the following properties:\r\n\r\n- `settings`: Exposes the settings object\r\n- `createWidgets`: Creates all cards found by the `Plyfe.settings.selector`\r\n- `createWidget`: Create one widget manually by passing in the HTML element (e.g. `Plyfe.createWidget(document.getElementById('custom-widget'));`).\r\n- `onCardStart`: Callback function that is called with `card` and `user` objects each time a user first interacts with a card.\r\n- `onCardComple`: Callback function that is called with `card` and `user` objects each time a user completes a card.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
